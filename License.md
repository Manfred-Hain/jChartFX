7. **ACTIVATION.** During installation, an Internet connection is required on the machine where
the product is being installed. Only the serial number and a unique product ID provided by the
installation program is sent to our servers. Alternatively, if necessary, this information could be
submitted from another computer that is connected to the Internet. The information is encrypted
using the standard RSA Public/Private key methodology. For security reasons, we do not copy
the private key onto the client machine; instead it resides on our servers and thus the need for an
Internet connection to obtain a code to complete the install of the software. Our installation does
not scan your hard drive or gather any personal information from your computer; therefore, no
privacy issues should be of concern to you. Customers are still encouraged to register the product
using the traditional and voluntary web site registration form. The installation process should be
simple and unobtrusive for all customers. Our goal is to prevent installation of serial numbers that
have been obtained from fraudulent purchases, returned products, expired programs and other
suspicious means.
